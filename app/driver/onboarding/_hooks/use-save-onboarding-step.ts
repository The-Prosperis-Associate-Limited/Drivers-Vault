  Every step saves the same way: PUT the step, refetch the profile the wizard
  reads onboarding_step from, then move on. Passing the next path here rather
  than navigating in the component keeps a step page to a form and nothing else.
  A step opened from the review screen's Edit link (?from=review) returns there
  after saving instead of marching through the remaining steps again. The query
  is read off window rather than useSearchParams — the hook version forces a
  Suspense boundary into every step page at prerender time.
